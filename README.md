Hospital Management Database System
This repository contains a Hospital Management Database System designed to handle patient information, room assignments, invoicing, and more. It was created by Zaheer Safi, in collaboration with Rizwan Mohammad and Sammy Dandu, under Professor Sara Riazi.

Overview
The project demonstrates how a hospital (or similar healthcare institution) can manage and track:

Patients and their health records
Physicians and Nurses, including task assignments
Room capacities and patient check-in/check-out
Invoices, Payables, Payments for financial operations
Instructions (doctor’s orders) and Medication administration
Its main goal is to show efficient data organization, consistent relationships, and clear data retrieval methods—ensuring healthcare providers and administrative staff can manage hospital operations with ease.

Getting Started

Run the relevant .sql scripts in the order specified (for creating tables, relationships, etc.).
(Refer to the files within this repository for the exact scripts.)
Insert Sample Data (Optional):

Populate the database with sample entries using the provided .sql inserts (or create your own).
Run the Queries:

Execute the query scripts to retrieve patient-room information, billing details, physician instructions, and more.
Test the Triggers and Transactions (if included in this repository):

Usage
Healthcare Staff can quickly view patient health records, room availability, and manage daily tasks.
Administrative/Finance Teams can generate invoices, process payments, and monitor overall financial activity.
Developers can adapt the schema, queries, triggers, and views to fit similar real-world database requirements.
