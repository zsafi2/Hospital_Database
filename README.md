# Hospital Management Database System

This repository contains a **Hospital Management Database System** designed to handle core hospital operationsâ€”such as patient management, room assignments, physician/nurse tasks, and billing. It was created by **Zaheer Safi**, in collaboration with **Rizwan Mohammad** and **Sammy Dandu**, under **Professor Sara Riazi**.

## Overview

The system demonstrates:
- **Patients**: Storing personal and health record information  
- **Physicians & Nurses**: Managing expertise, assigned tasks, and interactions with patients  
- **Rooms**: Assigning patients, tracking check-in/check-out dates, and updating capacity  
- **Invoices, Payables, and Payments**: Recording billing details and patient payments  

The design ensures proper relationships, data integrity, and convenient information retrieval through well-structured schemas, queries, and (optionally) triggers/transactions.

## How to Run
